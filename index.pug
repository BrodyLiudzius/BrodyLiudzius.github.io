        | I'm an undergrad student at Cal State Long Beach studying Computer Engineering.
        | This is just a temporary site where I can post my notes in a readable, digital form.
        | Everything here is under construction!
        | You may stumble accross notes that aren't fully written yet!
    p
        | Feel free to use or share any resources you find here.
        | I try to write my notes in an organized, concise, Wikipedia-inspired style.
        | I'm working on replacing this with a more polished personal site, but due to schoolwork, that won't be finished for a little while.

            | These are notes I've typed from my courses at CSULB.
            | I'm also working on typing up some of my old paper notes from before Spring 2024 and adding them as pages.
