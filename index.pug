        | Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! I'm a student at Cal State Long Beach studying Computer Engineering.
        | This is just a temporary site where I can post my notes in a readable, digital form.
        | Feel free to use or share any resources you find here while they last.
        | I'm working on replacing this with a more refined personal site, but due to schoolwork, that won't exist for a while.

            | These are notes I've typed from my courses here at CSULB.
            | They are intended to be written in an organized, concise, Wikipedia-inspired style.
            | I'm also working on typing up some of my old paper notes from before Spring 2024 and adding them as pages.
