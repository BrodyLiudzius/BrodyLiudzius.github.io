        | Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! I'm an undergrad student at Cal State Long Beach studying Computer Engineering.
        | This is just a temporary site where I can post my notes in a readable, digital form.
        | Feel free to use or share any resources you find here while they last.
        | I'm working on replacing this with a more complete and polished personal site, but due to schoolwork, that won't be finished for a little while.
    p
        | I try to write my notes in an organized, concise, Wikipedia-inspired style. Hopefully things are easy to find. I'll add a search feature in the near future.

            | These are notes I've typed from my courses here at CSULB.
            | I'm also working on typing up some of my old paper notes from before Spring 2024 and adding them as pages.
