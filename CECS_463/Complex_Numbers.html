The second axis is called the <em>imaginary axis</em> and a number in this plane is a vector.
Complex numbers arise naturally from algebra since there are many polynomials that have no roots in the real number vector space.
The complex number plane is the vector space of all roots of polynomial equations with degree one or higher provided the coefficients are real or complex numbers.</p></section><section id="Notation"><h2>Notation</h2><p>Imaginary numbers can be represented in rectangular (Cartesian) form or in polar form.
Rectangular form is very suitable to carrying out addition or subtraction of polar numbers, but not multiplication or division.
Polar form is well suited to multiplication and division, but not addition or subtraction.
Applying the complex conjugate is straigthforward in both notations.</p><section id="Rectangular_Form"><h3>Rectangular Form</h3><p>Generally the following notation is for complex numbers in rectangular form
\[ z=x+jy \tag{1} \]
where \(x\) and \(y\) are the real and imaginary portions of the number.
The symbol \(j\) being a unit vector on the imaginary axis.
Sometimes \(i\) is used instead, but for the purposes of DSP, \(j\) will be used.
The operations \( \Re \) and \( \Im \) are sometimes defined for imaginary numbers where \(\Re\) returns the real component
of the number and \(\Im\) returns the imaginary component (for example, \(\Re(z)=x\) and \(\Im(z)=y\)).</p><p>In rectangular form, addition or subtraction of two polar numbers, \(z_{1}=x_{1}+jy_{1}\) and \(z_{2}=x_{2}+jy_{2}\), is as simple as
\[ z_{1}+z_{2}=(x_{1}+x_{2}) + j(y_{1}+y_{2}) \]
\[ z_{1}-z_{2}=(x_{1}-x_{2}) + j(y_{1}-y_{2}) \]</p><p>The conjugate of \(z=x+jy\) would be
\[ \bar{z}=x-jy \]</p></section><section id="Polar_Form"><h3>Polar Form</h3><p>There are a couple notations for polar forms. The most intuitive is <dfn>angle notation</dfn>
\[ r\angle \theta \tag{2.1} \]
The other is the <dfn>complex exponential form</dfn>, which is derived from Euler's formula \( e^{j\theta}=cos(\theta)+j\sin(\theta) \).
\[ z=re^{j\theta} \tag{2.2} \]</p><p>Multiplication or division of two polar numbers, \(z_{1}=r_{1}e^{j\theta _{1}}\) and \(z_{2}=r_{2}e^{j\theta _{2}}\), is carried out as follows
\[ z_{1}\cdot z_{2}=(r_{1}r_{2})e^{j(\theta_{2}+\theta_{2})} \]
\[ \frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}=\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}e^{j(\theta_{2}-\theta_{2})} \]</p><p>The conjugate of \(z=re^{j\theta}\) would be
\[ \bar{z}=re^{-j\theta} \]</p><section id="Multiplicative_Inverse"><h4>Multiplicative Inverse</h4><p>The multiplicative inverse of \(z\), \(z^{-1}\) is
\[ z^{-1}=\frac{1}{r}e^{-j\theta} \tag{3} \]
For the particular case of \(z=0+j\), then
\[ z^{-1}=\frac{1}{j}=e^{-j\frac{\pi}{2}} \]</p></section></section><section id="Conversion_Between_Rectangular_and_Polar_Forms"><h3>Conversion Between Rectangular and Polar</h3><p>From polar to rectangular is the simpler of the two as the principal angle is already obtained.
\[ x=r\cos\theta \tag{4.1a} \]
\[ y=j\cdot r\sin\theta \tag{4.1b} \]</p><p>Conversion rectangular to polar is slightly more difficult as one needs to account for what quadrant the final vector will lie within.
This is because the formula uses the \(\arctan\) function which yields results in the range of \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)
whereas the polar representation can have an angle \(\theta\) in the range \(-\pi\) to \(\pi\).
So one might (or might not) need to add a value of \(\pi\) to obtain the <em>actual</em> value of \(\theta\).
\[ r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} \tag{4.2a} \]
\[ \theta =\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) \tag{4.2b} \]</p></section></section><hr><section id="References"><h2>References</h2><p>[1] J. H. McClellan, R. Schafer, M. Yoder, <i>DSP First</i>, 2nd ed.
